You are given a two-digit integer n. Return the sum of its digits.
For n = 29, the output should be
addTwoDigits(n) = 11.
solution:
int addTwoDigits(int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    int num = n;
    while (num > 0) {
        int lastDigit = num % 10;
        sum = sum+ lastDigit;
        num = num+ 10;
    }
    return sum;
}

Example

For n = 29, the output should be
addTwoDigits(n) = 11.

Given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product and return that product.
Example
For inputArray = [3, 6, -2, -5, 7, 3], the output should be
adjacentElementsProduct(inputArray) = 21.
7 and 3 produce the largest product. */

int adjacentElementsProduct(int[] inputArray) {
    int product = inputArray[0] * inputArray[1];
    for(int i = 1; i < inputArray.length-1; i++){

        if(temp > product){
            product = temp;

Input/Output
•	[execution time limit] 3 seconds (java)
•	[input] integer n
Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 9.
•	[output] integer
o	The largest integer of length n. */
Solution:

int largestNumber(int n) {

}
int result = Integer.parseInt(s);

You are playing an RPG game. Currently your experience points (XP) total is equal to experience. To reach the next level your XP should be at least at threshold. If you kill the monster in front of you, you will gain more experience points in the amount of the reward.
Given values experience, threshold and reward, check if you reach the next level after killing the monster.
Example
•	For experience = 10, threshold = 15, and reward = 5, the output should be
reachNextLevel(experience, threshold, reward) = true;
•	For experience = 10, threshold = 15, and reward = 4, the output should be
reachNextLevel(experience, threshold, reward) = false.

Solution:

boolean reachNextLevel(int experience, int threshold, int reward) {

    return experience + reward >= threshold;

}

Consider an arithmetic expression of the form a#b=c. Check whether it is possible to replace # with one of the four signs: +, -, * or /to obtain a correct expression.
Example
•	For a = 2, b = 3, and c = 5, the output should be
arithmeticExpression(a, b, c) = true.
We can replace # with a + to obtain 2 + 3 = 5, so the answer is true.
•	For a = 8, b = 2, and c = 4, the output should be
arithmeticExpression(a, b, c) = true.
We can replace # with a / to obtain 8 / 2 = 4, so the answer is true.
•	For a = 8, b = 3, and c = 2, the output should be
arithmeticExpression(a, b, c) = false.
o	8 + 3 = 11 ≠ 2;
o	8 - 3 = 5 ≠ 2;
o	8 * 3 = 24 ≠ 2;
o	8 / 3 = 2.(6) ≠ 2.
So the answer is false.
boolean arithmeticExpression(int A, int B, int C) {
    return A+B==C || A-B==C || A*B==C || A == B*C;
}


Intro:
Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n.
A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. An n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side. You can see the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-interesting polygons in the picture below.
 
Example
•	For n = 2, the output should be
shapeArea(n) = 5;
•	For n = 3, the output should be
shapeArea(n) = 13.

Solution:
int shapeArea(int n) {
    return n*n + (n-1)*(n-1);
}

n children have got m pieces of candy. They want to eat as much candy as they can, but each child must eat exactly the same amount of candy as any other child. Determine how many pieces of candy will be eaten by all the children together. Individual pieces of candy cannot be split.

Example

For n = 3 and m = 10, the output should be
candies(n, m) = 9.

Each child will eat 3 pieces. So the answer is 9.

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 3 seconds (java)

[input] integer n

The number of children.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 10.

[input] integer m

The number of pieces of candy.

Guaranteed constraints:
2 ≤ m ≤ 100.



Solution:
int candies(int n, int m) {
    if ((n > 10 || n < 1) || (m > 100 || m < 2)) {
    return 0;
    } 
    else if (n > m) {
    return 0;
    } 
    else if (n == m) {
    return m;
    } 
    else if (n < m) {
    int candyKids = Math.round(m / n);
    return candyKids * n;
    }
    return 0;

Given integers a and b, determine whether the following pseudocode results in an infinite loop
while a is not equal to b do
  increase a by 1
  decrease b by 1
Assume that the program is executed on a virtual machine which can store arbitrary long numbers and execute forever.
Example
•	For a = 2 and b = 6, the output should be
isInfiniteProcess(a, b) = false;
•	For a = 2 and b = 3, the output should be
isInfiniteProcess(a, b) = true.
Solution:
boolean isInfiniteProcess(int a, int b) {
return a > b || (b - a) % 2 == 1;
}
